IOS application  

I made Apple's tutorial application (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=11&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiWstnkytjkAhXCrZ4KHdxICTUQFjAKegQIARAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.apple.com%2Flibrary%2Farchive%2Freferencelibrary%2FGettingStarted%2FDevelopiOSAppsSwift%2F&usg=AOvVaw0bgrIeaUrtJEAxDXZmDNYW).  

I used Swift 5 rather than Swift 3 which the tutorial is designed for. This led to me running into moments where functions had been deprecated, which was actually a nice invitation to dive deeper into some interfaces/classes to figure out how to implement what I needed but also to gain a better understanding.
